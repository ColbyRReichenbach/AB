## **Executive Summary**

This report analyzes the performance of our marketing campaigns using a combination of exploratory data analysis (EDA), A/B testing, and Chi-square statistical tests. Our goal is to derive actionable insights to optimize ad spend, improve conversion rates, and drive overall marketing efficiency. The key focus areas are campaign performance, ad creative effectiveness, and the statistical significance of various demographic factors. This data-driven approach ensures our recommendations are rooted in evidence, helping to guide strategic decisions for future campaigns.

## **Introduction**

The data used in this report comes from a marketing campaign dataset tracking impressions, clicks, conversions, and related cost metrics across multiple campaigns and demographic segments. The core objectives of this analysis are to:

- Assess campaign effectiveness based on key performance indicators (KPIs).
- Identify the impact of ad creatives on user engagement.
- Determine the significance of demographic factors in conversion rates.
- Provide data-driven recommendations for marketing optimization.

## **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

### **Key Metrics Overview**

The initial EDA provides an overview of key metrics such as impressions, clicks, click-through rates (CTR), cost per click (CPC), cost per acquisition (CPA), and conversion rates.

- **CTR:** Mean = 1.64%, Max = 10.59%
- **CPC:** Mean = $1.23, Range = $0 - $2.21
- **CPA:** Mean = $20.71, Max = $352.45
- **Conversion Rate:** Mean = 8.93%, Max = 200%

### **Campaign Performance Analysis**

Campaign 916 significantly outperforms others with a **conversion rate of 14.16%** and a **CPA of $9.36**. Campaign 1178, despite having the highest impressions, underperforms with a **conversion rate of 2.41%** and a **CPA of $64.05**.

### **Segment Analysis**

While initial observations suggested differences in conversion rates across age and gender, statistical tests revealed **no significant differences**—suggesting that demographic-based targeting may not be the most effective strategy in this context.

### **Conversion Rate Analysis**

Interest categories 31 and 36 showed higher conversion rates (~6.5%), indicating that specific interest-based targeting can improve performance.

## **A/B Testing Analysis**

### **A/B Test 1: Campaign Performance**

#### **Objective:**
Compare the performance of different campaigns (916 vs 936, 916 vs 1178, 936 vs 1178) based on **conversion rates** and **CPA per impression**.

#### **Results:**

- **Campaign 916 vs 1178:** Significant difference in conversion rates (*p = 0.0030*), with Campaign 916 outperforming.
- **Campaign 936 vs 1178:** Highly significant difference (*p < 0.0001*), with Campaign 936 outperforming Campaign 1178.
- **Campaign 916 vs 936:** No significant difference (*p > 0.05*).

#### **Insights:**

- **Campaign 1178’s poor performance** suggests inefficiencies in targeting or ad fatigue.
- **Campaign 916’s strong performance** warrants budget scaling and deeper analysis of successful tactics.

---

### **A/B Test 2: Ad Creative Effectiveness**

#### **Objective:**
Determine the impact of ad creatives on **CTR** and **conversion rates**.

#### **Results:**

- Significant difference in CTR between top and bottom-performing ads (*p < 0.0001*).
- Top 25% of ads had a **CTR of 3.8%**, compared to **0.9%** for the bottom 25%.

#### **Insights:**

- Creative elements such as compelling headlines, strong CTAs, and engaging visuals **directly impact engagement**.
- **Scaling high-performing ad features** and conducting regular creative refreshes can sustain performance.

---

## **Chi-Square Test Analysis**

#### **Objective:**
Test for associations between demographic factors (age, gender, interests) and conversion rates.

#### **Results:**

- **Gender:** No significant association (*p = 0.345*).
- **Age:** No significant association (*p = 0.921*).
- **Interests:** No significant association (*p = 0.673*).

#### **Insights:**

Demographics are **not strong predictors** of conversion rates. Efforts should focus on **ad creatives** and **campaign strategies** instead.
