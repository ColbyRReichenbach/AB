## **Executive Summary**

This report presents an in-depth analysis of the company's marketing campaigns, uncovering critical insights into **conversion performance, ad creative effectiveness, and demographic impacts**. Our findings guide actionable strategies to optimize campaign efficiency, reduce costs, and enhance ROI.

---

## **Introduction**

The goal of this analysis is to evaluate the performance of marketing campaigns to identify high-impact strategies. We focus on:

- **Conversion Rates**
- **Cost Per Acquisition (CPA)**
- **Click-Through Rates (CTR)**
- **Demographic Impact**

---

## **Methodology**

1. **Data Cleaning:** Removed anomalies (e.g., conversions without clicks) for accuracy.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Identified trends, correlations, and outliers.
3. **A/B Testing:** Compared campaigns and ad performance based on CTR, CPA, and conversion rates.
4. **Chi-Square Tests:** Assessed demographic influences on conversion rates.

## **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

### **Data Overview**

- **Total Records:** 1,143 ad campaigns analyzed  
- **Key Variables:** Campaign IDs, Age, Gender, Interests, Impressions, Clicks, Spend, Conversions  

### **Descriptive Statistics**

| Metric                | Mean       | Median     | Min     | Max        | Std Dev    |
|-----------------------|------------|------------|---------|------------|------------|
| Impressions           | 186,732    | 51,509     | 87      | 3,052,003  | 312,762    |
| Clicks                | 41         | 16         | 1       | 421        | 60         |
| Spent ($)             | 51.36      | 12.37      | 0       | 639.95     | 86.91      |
| Total Conversions     | 2.86       | 1          | 0       | 60         | 4.48       |
| Approved Conversions  | 1.85       | 1          | 0       | 21         | 2.06       |

### **Correlation Analysis**

- **Clicks and Spend:** Strong positive correlation (r ≈ 0.85), meaning higher spend drives more clicks.
- **Impressions and Conversions:** Weak correlation (r ≈ 0.3), suggesting impressions alone aren’t enough for conversions.

### **Funnel Analysis**

**Impressions → Clicks → Conversions → Approved Conversions**

- **Conversion Drop-Off:** 73% drop from clicks to approved conversions, highlighting post-click optimization opportunities.

---

## **Key Observations**

1. **High CPA in Campaign 1178:**  
   - **CPA:** $64.05 (6.8x higher than Campaign 916's $9.36)  
   - **Reason:** Low conversion rates (2.4%) despite high impressions. This indicates inefficient targeting or poor post-click experience.

2. **Campaign 916 Efficiency:**  
   - **Conversion Rate:** 14.1% (4.7x higher than Campaign 1178)  
   - **CTR:** 2.5%, maintaining cost efficiency while driving strong conversions.

3. **Ad Creative Impact:**  
   - Top ads achieved CTRs **3-5x higher** than bottom-performing ones, emphasizing the importance of ad copy and visuals.

4. **Demographic Insights:**  
   - No significant impact of **gender, age, or interests** on conversion rates (p > 0.05), suggesting behavioral targeting may outperform demographic segmentation.

## **A/B Testing Results**

### **Campaign Performance**

| **Comparison**          | **Conversion Rate (p-value)** | **CPA per Impression (p-value)** | **Insight**                         |
|-------------------------|-------------------------------|----------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| **916 vs 1178**         | **0.0030** (Significant)      | 0.1410 (Not Significant)         | 916 outperforms in conversions     |
| **916 vs 936**          | 0.4873 (Not Significant)      | 0.3733 (Not Significant)         | No significant difference          |
| **936 vs 1178**         | **2.30 × 10⁻¹²** (Significant) | 0.0901 (Marginal)                | 936 significantly outperforms 1178 |

### **Insights from A/B Testing:**

- **Campaign 916 vs 1178:** The p-value (0.0030) indicates a **statistically significant difference** in conversion rates. Campaign 916 has a **conversion rate 4.7x higher** than Campaign 1178. Despite Campaign 1178’s high impressions, it fails to convert efficiently, leading to a **much higher CPA**.

- **Campaign 936 vs 1178:** Again, a **highly significant result (p = 2.30 × 10⁻¹²)**. Campaign 936 outperforms Campaign 1178 in conversion rates. However, **Campaign 936’s CPA is higher compared to 916**, making 916 more cost-effective in the long run.

- **Why Not Focus Solely on Campaign 936?**  
  While Campaign 936 outperforms 1178, it **does not show a significant improvement** over Campaign 916. Additionally, the **cost-efficiency** of Campaign 916 (lower CPA) makes it a more favorable option.

## **Chi-Square Analysis**

| **Demographic Factor** | **Chi-Square Statistic** | **P-Value** | **Result**                     |
|------------------------|--------------------------|-------------|--------------------------------|
| **Gender vs Conversion**   | 15.49                    | 0.3453      | Not Significant               |
| **Age vs Conversion**      | 29.80                    | 0.9211      | Not Significant               |
| **Interest vs Conversion** | 530.66                   | 0.6731      | Not Significant               |

### **Insights from Chi-Square Testing:**

- The **high p-values (> 0.05)** across gender, age, and interests indicate **no statistically significant relationship** between these demographics and conversion rates.

- **What Does This Mean?**  
  It suggests that **demographic segmentation alone is not an effective strategy**. Instead of focusing on who the audience is (age, gender), **behavioral targeting** (such as user activity, retargeting, and interests) may be more impactful.

---

## **Strategic Recommendations**

1. **Reallocate Budget:**  
   - **Why Move from Campaign 1178?**  
     - Despite high impressions, **Campaign 1178’s CPA is $64.05**, making it cost-inefficient.  
   - **Focus on Campaign 916:**  
     - A **CPA of $9.36** with a stable conversion rate of 14.1% offers a better ROI.

2. **Ad Hybrid Strategy:**  
   - **Blend High-Click with High-Conversion Ads:**  
     - Leverage creative elements from high-CTR ads and combine them with content from high-conversion ads to improve performance.

3. **Investigate Campaign 1178:**  
   - Although conversions are low, **the ad generates substantial impressions**.  
   - **Action:** Review ad content, landing pages, and targeting to optimize performance.

4. **Prioritize Behavioral Targeting:**  
   - Since demographics don’t significantly influence conversions, shift to **behavioral data-driven targeting** strategies.

---

## **Future Testing Opportunities**

1. **Multivariate Testing:**  
   - Test different combinations of headlines, CTAs, and images.

2. **Landing Page Optimization Tests:**  
   - Determine if specific landing pages correlate with conversion drops.

3. **Time-Based Analysis:**  
   - Assess ad performance based on the time of day or week.

---

## **Conclusion**

The analysis confirms that **ad creatives, campaign strategies, and behavioral targeting** have a greater impact on performance than demographics. **Campaign 916** demonstrates cost-efficiency and strong conversion rates, making it the optimal campaign to scale.
